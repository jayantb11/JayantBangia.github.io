									<p>I selected a dataset comprising 3181 days of Tesla stock information and performed a detailed analysis. Using Pandas commands, I examined model information and extracted closing time data from various timestamps in the stock dataset. To visualize the stock trend, I employed Matplotlib and Plotly. Building a linear regression model involved preprocessing steps like MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler from the sklearn library. The result was a closely matched R2 score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the actual and predicted data, with a margin of only 2%. This project showcased my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.</p>

									<p>I worked on a breast cancer dataset sourced from Kaggle, which included information on 4000 patients. Utilizing the factor_analyzer library, I conducted factor analysis to understand the relationships within the data. The analysis revealed a significant correlation of 0.68 between age and regional node size. To ensure data integrity, I executed data cleaning procedures, removing outliers with the pandas library. Additionally, I performed adequacy tests like KMO and Bartlettâ€™s test to assess the dataset's fitness for analysis. The results were visualized using a heatmap created with the seaborn library.</p>

									<p>The World Population Data Analysis project involves comprehensive exploration and examination of global population trends using a DataFrame. The initial step involves sorting the data by the "2022 Population" column in descending order and presenting the top 10 countries. Subsequently, the data is grouped by continent, and the mean population values are calculated for each continent, with results sorted by the 2022 population in descending order. To focus specifically on Oceania, rows containing the 'Oceania' substring in the "Continent" column are filtered. The project further delves into visual representation.</p>

									<p>I randomly took a customer's Excel sheet and performed data cleaning using various pandas commands such as drop, strip, replace, etc. This was done to ensure that the dataset is well-prepared and suitable for subsequent data analysis. The cleaning process involved eliminating unnecessary information, removing extra spaces, and replacing incorrect values, among other operations, to enhance the overall quality and integrity of the data.</p>

									<p>As a TechOps Engineer at Paytm Payments Bank in Noida, I played a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless functioning and effectiveness of the payment gateway. There, I used SQL to identify various missing or mismatched data from different relational tables and learned about various bank flows present at the Unix end of the gateway. Th knowledge helped me assist registered merchants with the technical aspects of errors occurring on their payment side.
										I also utilized monitoring tools such as Kibana and Grafana to check the increase or decrease in the failure rate of transactions and refunds. I reported these errors to the concerned team. Additionally, I created reports from SQL table data in Excel, using tools such as Vlookup and pivot tables. These reports focused on weekly queues listed in Jira tickets to find key performance indicators (KPIs) and to reduce operational and resource costs.

									<p>I am actively engaged in a diverse array of activities, balancing my passion for artificial intelligence with a keen interest in sports and music. As an enthusiast of AI, I stay updated on the latest advancements in the field, ensuring that my knowledge is current and relevant. In addition to my intellectual pursuits, I find joy in watching basketball matches and immersing myself in the rhythm of music. On the organizational front, I take on leadership roles, serving as the Secretary of the Graduate Consulting Club at Stevens Institute of Technology and spearheading women's leadership events at the same institution. Furthermore, my involvement in Model United Nations (MUN) and participation in climate change summits reflect my commitment to global issues. In my creative capacity, I contribute to event organization as a member of the creative team at Chitkara University. This diverse combination of interests and roles shapes my holistic approach to personal and professional growth.</p>
